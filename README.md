# ESP32
In this project, I will try to run a **computer vision application on ESP32**. 
 - The application should be able to oranges and apples apart in pictures. <br> 
 - The application will be running on a web server on the ESP32 itself.

But at first, to familiarize with ESP32, I had to run the *Blink* standard example. The following paragraph is somewhat a tutorial to blinking a LED on ESP32 for the first time.
